# ruby-linked-lists
This is my recreation of the [linked list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list) DSA structure as a part of my [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) journey (TOP).

This project is a testament of proving my basic proficiency on Computer Science, learnt from the Ruby path from the Odin Project. The software is capable of replicating the functions of a linked list, a data structure that can be found on other programming languages, but Ruby doesn't have it (although the Array class somewhat mimics it). The repo comes with a linked_list.rb and a main.rb file, the former contains the various functions to simulate a linked list class, the latter has the purpose to test the linked list "class" on a clean sheet with an example program included. You can modify main.rb to do all the things that linked_list.rb can do.

## How do you run it?
In order to run this wonderful piece of software, you need to open your Git/Linux/MacOS terminal and navigate to ../ruby-linked-lists and then run ruby main.rb to see the results coming from that file.
